Pros
======

Superb craftsmanship
instant loading awesome

Cons
======

Specific
------

When I change the screen orientation on mobile, the login/signup red background freaks out and covers only part of the screen for a second.

Some text is selectable that shouldn't be (i.e. # of votes)

All polls say "Professor Lo's Poll"--even those I created

When I logged in on mobile, the app vomited. (See screenshots.)

Broad
------

The Login/signup dynamic is a little weird. I wasn't quite sure whether to create an accountI should type in an email/password or click somewhere else to go to a "create account" page. The current solution may be perfect; let's see what Derek's dad thinks.

Why can't I delete a poll?

On mobile, I find the interface perhaps too small and hard to read.
